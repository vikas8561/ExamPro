be# Sticky Sidebar Testing Plan

## Testing Instructions

To verify the sticky sidebar functionality, please follow these steps:

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Student Portal

#### A. Navigate to the Student Portal
- Go to the main student portal page.

#### B. Verify Sidebar Behavior
- Scroll down the page and observe the sidebar.
- Confirm that the sidebar remains fixed to the top of the viewport while scrolling.
- Ensure that the content in the main area scrolls independently of the sidebar.

### 3. Test Different Screen Sizes
- Resize the browser window to different widths (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Verify that the sidebar remains sticky and behaves correctly across all screen sizes.

### 4. Expected Behavior
- The sidebar should not move out of view when scrolling.
- The main content should scroll independently of the sidebar.
- No visual glitches or layout issues should occur.

### 5. Common Issues to Check
- Ensure the sidebar does not overlap with the main content.
- Check for any z-index issues that may cause the sidebar to be hidden behind other elements.
- Confirm that the sidebar is responsive and maintains its sticky behavior on all devices.

## Implementation Summary
The sidebar was modified to be sticky by wrapping it in a div with the classes `sticky top-0 h-screen`. This ensures that it remains fixed at the top of the viewport during scrolling.

## Testing Confirmation
Please confirm that the sidebar behaves as expected after testing.
