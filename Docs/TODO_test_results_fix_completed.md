# TODO: Fix Test Results Display for Incomplete Tests - COMPLETED

## Objective
Allow students to see questions with correct answers even if they didn't answer any questions.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (testSubmissions.js)
- Modified the GET /assignment/:assignmentId route to handle cases where no submission exists
- When no submission is found, the API now returns test questions with correct answers
- Added logic to determine if results should be shown based on deadline and submission status
- Updated response structure to include placeholder data for missing submissions

### Frontend Changes (ViewTestResults.jsx)
- Added logic to detect when no submission exists (`hasNoSubmission = !submission._id`)
- The component now properly displays questions with correct answers even when no responses were submitted
- UI shows "Not answered" for questions without responses
- Maintains existing functionality for cases where submissions do exist

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the backend server: `cd Backend && node server.js`
2. Start the frontend: `cd Frontend && npm run dev`
3. Test the functionality by accessing a test assignment where no submission was made
4. Verify that questions with correct answers are displayed instead of the "No test submission data" message

## Expected Behavior
- Students should now be able to see all questions with correct answers even if they didn't submit any responses
- The system should show "Not answered" for questions without responses
- The score summary should show 0 points for tests that weren't submitted
- All existing functionality for completed tests should remain unchanged
