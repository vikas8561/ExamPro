# Video Implementation Plan

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Frontend Implementation
- [x] Add video element to TakeTest.jsx component
- [x] Implement camera permission request and handling
- [x] Add video stream management with proper cleanup
- [x] Display live video feed in the navigation sidebar
- [x] Ensure video is muted and auto-plays when permissions are granted
- [x] Add proper error handling for camera access denial

### Backend Considerations
- [x] No backend changes required for basic video implementation
- [x] Video data is handled client-side only (no streaming to server)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes Made:
1. **Added video state management**:
   - `stream` state to manage the video stream
   - `isVideoActive` state to track video status
   - `videoRef` reference for the video element

2. **Enhanced permission handling**:
   - Modified `checkCameraPermission()` to start video stream when granted
   - Added proper error handling for camera denial

3. **Video element integration**:
   - Added `<video>` element in the navigation sidebar
   - Video displays only when camera permission is granted
   - Auto-plays and muted for user privacy

4. **Cleanup implementation**:
   - Added useEffect cleanup to stop video tracks on component unmount
   - Proper stream management to prevent memory leaks

## 🎯 Features Implemented

- ✅ Live video monitoring during tests
- ✅ Camera permission request and handling
- ✅ Video display in test interface
- ✅ Proper cleanup and error handling
- ✅ Muted video for user privacy

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

For advanced features, consider:
- Recording video snippets during suspicious activities
- Integrating with backend for video storage/analysis
- Adding audio monitoring (requires additional permissions)
- Implementing screen sharing monitoring

## 📝 Notes

- The video implementation is currently client-side only
- No video data is sent to the server in this implementation
- Users must grant camera permissions to proceed with the test
- Video is automatically stopped when the test is submitted or component unmounts
