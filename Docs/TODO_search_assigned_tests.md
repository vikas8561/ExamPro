# TODO: Implement Search Functionality in Assigned Tests Section

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Add searchTerm state variable
- [x] Add search input field in the UI above the assignments grid
- [x] Implement filtering logic for assignments based on search term (title, type, mentor name, status)
- [x] Update the assignments display to use filtered results
- [x] Test the search functionality

## Details:
- Search should be case-insensitive
- Search across: test title, test type, mentor name, assignment status
- Real-time filtering as user types
- Preserve existing functionality
