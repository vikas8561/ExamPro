## Phase 3: Testing - READY FOR TESTING
- [ ] Test student cannot see scores before mentor review
- [ ] Test mentor review flow works correctly  
- [ ] Test student can see results after mentor submission
- [ ] Test student can view submitted answers during review period

## Key Features Implemented:
1. **Student Experience**: Students can view their submitted answers immediately after submission, but scores and correctness indicators are hidden until mentor review
2. **Mentor Experience**: Mentors can review submissions through the existing MentorSubmissions interface
3. **Review Status**: Clear visual indicators show whether a submission is pending review or has been reviewed
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality for reviewed submissions remains unchanged

## Files Modified:
- `Backend/routes/testSubmissions.js` - Enhanced API response structure
- `Frontend/src/pages/ViewTestResults.jsx` - Conditional rendering based on review status
- `Frontend/src/pages/StudentAssignments.jsx` - Different buttons for reviewed vs unreviewed assignments

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The system now prevents students from seeing their test results until a mentor has reviewed and approved them, while still allowing students to view what they submitted.
