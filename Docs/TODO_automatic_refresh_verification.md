# TODO: Automatic Refresh Verification and Improvement

## Overview
Verify and improve the automatic refresh implementation for the student portal when assignments are created using Socket.IO.

## Current Implementation Status
- [x] Socket.IO server setup in Backend/server.js
- [x] Event emission in Backend/routes/assignments.js
- [x] Socket.IO client connection in Frontend/src/pages/StudentDashboard.jsx
- [x] Event listening and data refresh in StudentDashboard.jsx

## Steps to Verify and Improve
- [ ] Verify Socket.IO server configuration and CORS settings
- [ ] Check environment variables for API URL consistency
- [ ] Verify userId storage and retrieval in localStorage
- [ ] Test socket connection and room joining
- [ ] Verify event emission on assignment creation
- [ ] Test automatic refresh functionality
- [ ] Add error handling and connection status indicators
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for failed connections
- [ ] Improve logging for debugging

## Files to Review/Edit
- Backend/server.js: Socket.IO server setup
- Backend/routes/assignments.js: Event emission
- Frontend/src/pages/StudentDashboard.jsx: Socket.IO client
- Environment variables: VITE_API_URL, FRONTEND_URL

## Testing Steps
- Start backend server
- Start frontend development server
- Login as admin and create/assign a test
- Login as student in another browser
- Verify student dashboard updates automatically
- Check browser console for socket connection logs
