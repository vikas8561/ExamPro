# 🚨 SAFE DEPLOYMENT PLAN - EXAM IN PROGRESS

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT DEPLOY DURING ACTIVE EXAM

Since an exam is currently running, **DO NOT** push the CORS changes to production right now. This could:
- Disconnect students from their tests
- Cause data loss
- Disrupt the exam session
- Create panic among students

## 📊 Current Situation Analysis

### What We Know:
- **CORS errors** are affecting some students (not all)
- **Exam is currently active** with students taking tests
- **Backend changes are ready** but not deployed
- **Some students can access** while others cannot

### Risk Assessment:
- **HIGH RISK**: Deploying now could disconnect active test sessions
- **MEDIUM RISK**: CORS issues are intermittent, not affecting all students
- **LOW RISK**: The CORS fix is non-breaking and only adds headers

## 🛡️ Safe Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Monitor Current Issues (NOW)
```bash
# Check server logs without making changes
# Monitor which students are affected
# Document the exact error patterns
```

### Phase 2: Wait for Exam Completion
- **Wait until ALL students complete their exams**
- **Verify no active test sessions**
- **Check assignment statuses are "Completed" or "Overdue"**

### Phase 3: Safe Deployment Window
**Deploy ONLY when:**
- ✅ No students have `status: "In Progress"` assignments
- ✅ All active test sessions are completed
- ✅ Server logs show no active connections
- ✅ You have a maintenance window

## 🔍 How to Check if Exam is Still Active

### Method 1: Check Assignment Statuses
```javascript
// Query to check for active exams
db.assignments.find({
  status: "In Progress",
  startedAt: { $exists: true }
})
```

### Method 2: Check Server Logs
Look for:
- Active Socket.IO connections
- Recent API calls to `/api/assignments/student`
- Students with `status: "In Progress"`

### Method 3: Use Debug Endpoint
```bash
# Check if any assignments are in progress
GET /api/debug/assignments/active
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying CORS Fix:
- [ ] **Confirm NO students are taking tests**
- [ ] **Check all assignments are "Completed" or "Overdue"**
- [ ] **Verify no active Socket.IO connections**
- [ ] **Backup current server state**
- [ ] **Have rollback plan ready**
- [ ] **Notify students of brief maintenance window**

### Deployment Steps (AFTER EXAM):
1. **Wait for exam completion**
2. **Verify no active sessions**
3. **Deploy CORS changes**
4. **Test endpoints immediately**
5. **Monitor for 10 minutes**
6. **Confirm all students can access**

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback Plan

If deployment causes issues:
```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## 📞 Communication Plan

### If Students Report Issues:
1. **Acknowledge the CORS problem**
2. **Explain it's a known issue**
3. **Assure them it will be fixed after exam**
4. **Provide alternative access if possible**

### After Exam Completion:
1. **Send maintenance notification**
2. **Deploy CORS fix**
3. **Test thoroughly**
4. **Confirm all students can access**

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions (If Urgent)

### Option 1: Temporary CORS Proxy
- Use a CORS proxy service temporarily
- Route requests through proxy
- No backend changes needed

### Option 2: Frontend Workaround
- Modify frontend to handle CORS errors gracefully
- Add retry logic for failed requests
- Show user-friendly error messages

### Option 3: Wait and Monitor
- Monitor current CORS issues
- Document which students are affected
- Deploy fix after exam completion

## 📊 Monitoring Commands

### Check Active Sessions:
```bash
# Check server logs for active connections
# Monitor assignment statuses
# Watch for CORS errors in logs
```

### Test CORS After Deployment:
```bash
# Test from browser console
fetch('https://cg-test-app.onrender.com/health')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('CORS test:', data))
```

## ⏰ Recommended Timeline

1. **NOW**: Monitor current issues, document affected students
2. **DURING EXAM**: Do nothing, let students complete tests
3. **AFTER EXAM**: Deploy CORS fix during maintenance window
4. **POST-DEPLOYMENT**: Test thoroughly, confirm all students can access

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After deployment:
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ All students can access dashboard
- ✅ Socket.IO connections work
- ✅ API calls succeed from Vercel frontend
- ✅ No student complaints about access issues

## 📝 Final Recommendation

**WAIT UNTIL EXAM COMPLETION** before deploying the CORS fix. The current CORS issues are affecting some students but not all, and deploying during an active exam could cause more problems than it solves.

The CORS fix is ready and will resolve the issues, but timing is critical for student success.
