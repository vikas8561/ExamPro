# Fix for Test Start 404 Error

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Update API service to handle 404 errors more gracefully for test submissions
   - Modified `api.js` to return null instead of throwing errors for expected 404 responses on test submission endpoints
   - Added filtering to prevent console logging of expected 404 errors

2. [ ] Add better logging in TakeTest component to understand the flow
3. [ ] Test the changes to ensure 404 errors are handled properly

## Current Status:
- The backend route for fetching test submissions exists and works correctly
- The frontend tries to fetch submissions when a test is already in progress
- 404 errors are expected when no submission exists yet
- API service now handles 404 responses gracefully without console errors

## Next Steps:
- Add better logging to TakeTest component to track the flow
- Test the application to ensure the fix works correctly
