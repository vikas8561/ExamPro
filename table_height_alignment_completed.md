# Table Height Alignment - COMPLETED

## Task: Make Tests table height align with sidebar height

### Changes made to Frontend/src/pages/Tests.jsx:
1. ✅ Added `h-screen flex flex-col` to main container for full height layout
2. ✅ Added `flex-grow` to table container to fill remaining space
3. ✅ Changed inner container to `h-full` for proper height inheritance

### Implementation details:
- Main container now uses full viewport height with flex column layout
- Table container uses flex-grow to expand and fill available space
- Inner scrolling container uses h-full to inherit parent height
- Maintained all existing functionality and styling

### Result:
The Tests table should now align perfectly with the sidebar height, creating a consistent layout where both the sidebar and table container occupy the full viewport height.
