# Scrollable Tables Testing Plan

## Testing Instructions

To verify the scrollable table functionality, please follow these steps:

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Each Modified Component

#### A. Tests Page (Admin)
- Navigate to: `/tests`
- Verify:
  - Table has fixed height (max 24rem/96px)
  - Header row remains sticky at top during scrolling
  - Vertical scrolling works when content exceeds container height
  - All existing functionality (edit, delete, assign) works correctly

#### B. Users Page (Admin)
- Navigate to: `/users`
- Verify:
  - Table has fixed height (max 24rem/96px)
  - Header row remains sticky at top during scrolling
  - Vertical scrolling works when content exceeds container height
  - All existing functionality (create, edit, delete) works correctly

#### C. Student Dashboard (Student)
- Navigate to: `/student/dashboard`
- Verify:
  - Both "Assigned Tests" and "Completed Tests" tables have scrollable containers
  - Header rows remain sticky during scrolling
  - Vertical scrolling works for both tables
  - All existing functionality remains intact

#### D. Student Results (Student)
- Navigate to: `/student/results`
- Verify:
  - Table has scrollable container
  - Header row remains sticky during scrolling
  - Vertical scrolling works when content exceeds container height

#### E. Reviews Page (Admin/Mentor)
- Navigate to: `/reviews`
- Verify:
  - Table has fixed height (max 24rem/96px)
  - Header row remains sticky at top during scrolling
  - Vertical scrolling works when content exceeds container height
  - All existing functionality (approve, reject, delete) works correctly

#### F. Assignments Page (Admin)
- Navigate to: `/assignments`
- Verify:
  - Table has fixed height (max 24rem/96px)
  - Header row remains sticky at top during scrolling
  - Vertical scrolling works when content exceeds container height
  - All existing functionality (create, delete) works correctly

### 3. Test Different Data Scenarios
- Test with empty tables (no data)
- Test with few items (1-5 items)
- Test with many items (enough to require scrolling)
- Test with various screen sizes (responsive design)

### 4. Expected Behavior
- Tables should not extend page length beyond 24rem height
- Headers should remain visible at top during scrolling
- Scrolling should be smooth and responsive
- All existing functionality should remain unchanged
- No visual glitches or layout issues

### 5. Common Issues to Check
- Header z-index issues (should be above content)
- Scrollbar appearance and styling
- Table border and background consistency
- Responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Implementation Summary

The following scrollable table features were implemented:
- `max-h-96` class for fixed height (24rem)
- `overflow-y-auto` for vertical scrolling
- `sticky top-0` for fixed headers
- `z-10` for proper layering
- Maintained existing styling and functionality
