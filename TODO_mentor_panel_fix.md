# Mentor Panel Data Fix - Test Assignment and Test Submissions

## Problem Identified
Data is not showing in the Test Assignment and Test Submissions section on the mentor panel.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Duplicate Endpoints**: There are two different endpoints for getting pending submissions:
   - `/api/test-submissions/mentor/pending` (in testSubmissions.js)
   - `/api/mentor/submissions/pending` (in mentor.js)

2. **Frontend Confusion**: The frontend is calling `/mentor/submissions/pending` which should map to the route in mentor.js, but there might be routing conflicts or implementation differences.

3. **Error Handling Differences**: The two endpoints had different error handling patterns.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (mentor.js)
1. **Updated `/submissions/pending` route**:
   - Added proper error handling with `next(error)` pattern
   - Added detailed console logging for debugging
   - Standardized error handling to match testSubmissions.js

2. **Updated `/submissions/:submissionId/review` route**:
   - Added score validation (0-100 range)
   - Added proper error handling with `next(error)` pattern
   - Added mentorFeedback to assignment update

### Frontend Changes (MentorSubmissions.jsx)
- No changes needed to endpoints as they are correctly calling `/mentor/submissions/pending` and `/mentor/submissions/:submissionId/review`

## Next Steps for Testing
1. **Start the backend server** to test the changes
2. **Check console logs** to see if the endpoints are being called correctly
3. **Verify data flow**:
   - Check if assignments are properly assigned to mentors
   - Check if submissions are being created with correct assignment IDs
   - Verify that the population of test and user data is working correctly

## Potential Additional Issues
1. **Assignment Creation**: Ensure assignments are created with proper `mentorId` fields
2. **Submission Creation**: Ensure submissions are linked to the correct assignments
3. **Database Population**: Verify that the population of testId and userId is working correctly in the queries

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Start backend server
cd Backend && npm start

# Check console logs for:
# - "Fetching pending submissions for mentor: [mentorId]"
# - "Found [X] assignments for mentor [mentorId]"
# - "Found [X] pending submissions for review"
```

## Files Modified
- `Backend/routes/mentor.js` - Updated pending submissions and review endpoints
