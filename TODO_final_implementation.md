# Implementation Plan for Mentor Panel Fix and 404 Error Handling

## Steps to Complete:

### 1. Backend Cleanup (testSubmissions.js)
- [x] Remove duplicate `/mentor/pending` endpoint from testSubmissions.js
- [x] Ensure consistent error handling pattern

### 2. Frontend Improvements (TakeTest.jsx)
- [x] Add 404 error handling for test submission fetching
- [x] Add proper logging to understand test flow

### 3. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Start backend server and test mentor panel
- [ ] Verify data shows correctly in mentor submissions
- [ ] Test 404 error handling in TakeTest component

## Current Status: Ready for Testing

## Changes Made:

### Backend Changes:
- Removed duplicate `/mentor/pending` endpoint from `Backend/routes/testSubmissions.js`
- Kept the endpoint in `Backend/routes/mentor.js` as the primary one

### Frontend Changes:
- Enhanced logging in `TakeTest.jsx` with detailed console messages prefixed with `[TakeTest]`
- Improved 404 error handling for submission fetching
- Added comprehensive debugging information for test flow analysis

## Next Steps:
1. Start backend server: `cd Backend && npm start`
2. Test mentor panel functionality at `/mentor/submissions`
3. Test TakeTest component with various scenarios including 404 responses
4. Verify console logs show proper debugging information
