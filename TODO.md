# Fix for Test Start 404 Error

## Steps to Complete:

1. [ ] Update API service to handle 404 errors more gracefully for test submissions
2. [ ] Add better logging in TakeTest component to understand the flow
3. [ ] Test the changes to ensure 404 errors are handled properly

## Current Status:
- The backend route for fetching test submissions exists and works correctly
- The frontend tries to fetch submissions when a test is already in progress
- 404 errors are expected when no submission exists yet
- Need to prevent console errors for expected 404 responses
