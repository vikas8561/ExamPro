- [x] Frontend/src/pages/MentorSubmissions.jsx already displays student's answers with correct answers comparison
- [x] Visual indicators for correct/incorrect answers already in the UI
- [x] Updated mentor panel to show ALL test submissions (not filtered by mentor assignments)
- [ ] Investigate why responses.isCorrect is not set during test submission - check test submission logic
