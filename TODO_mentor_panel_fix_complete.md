# Mentor Panel Data Fix - Test Assignment and Test Submissions

## Problem Identified
Data is not showing in the Test Assignment and Test Submissions section on the mentor panel.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Duplicate Endpoints**: There are two different endpoints for getting pending submissions:
   - `/api/test-submissions/mentor/pending` (in testSubmissions.js)
   - `/api/mentor/submissions/pending` (in mentor.js)

2. **Frontend Confusion**: The frontend is calling `/mentor/submissions/pending` which should map to the route in mentor.js, but there might be routing conflicts or implementation differences.

3. **Error Handling Differences**: The two endpoints had different error handling patterns.

4. **Role Case Sensitivity**: The available mentors endpoint was looking for role "mentor" (lowercase) but the User model uses "Mentor" (capitalized).

5. **Bulk Assignment Issue**: The bulk assignment creation route (`/assign-all`) was not setting `mentorId` for assignments, making them invisible to mentors.

## Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Fixed Role Case Sensitivity (`Backend/routes/assignments.js`)
- Changed `User.find({ role: "mentor" })` to `User.find({ role: "Mentor" })` in the `/mentors/available` endpoint

#### 2. Fixed Bulk Assignment Creation (`Backend/routes/assignments.js`)
- Added `mentorId` parameter to the `/assign-all` endpoint
- Set `mentorId: mentorId || null` for assignments created in bulk

#### 3. Improved Population Structure (`Backend/routes/mentor.js`)
- Updated the `/submissions/pending` route to directly populate `testId` and `userId` instead of nesting through `assignmentId`
- Added proper error handling with `next(error)` pattern
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

#### 4. Enhanced Review Endpoint (`Backend/routes/mentor.js`)
- Added score validation (0-100 range)
- Added proper error handling with `next(error)` pattern
- Added `mentorFeedback` to assignment updates

### Migration Script Created
- `Backend/scripts/migrateMentorAssignments.js` - Script to assign a default mentor to existing assignments that don't have a mentor ID

## Files Modified
- `Backend/routes/assignments.js` - Fixed role case sensitivity and bulk assignment mentor assignment
- `Backend/routes/mentor.js` - Improved population structure and error handling
- `Backend/scripts/migrateMentorAssignments.js` - Created migration script

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Start backend server
cd Backend && npm start

# Run migration script (after server is running)
cd Backend && node scripts/migrateMentorAssignments.js

# Check console logs for:
# - "Fetching pending submissions for mentor: [mentorId]"
# - "Found [X] assignments for mentor [mentorId]"
# - "Found [X] pending submissions for review"
```

## Expected Results
- Mentors should now see pending submissions in their panel
- The frontend should correctly display test titles and student names
- Bulk assignments will now be assigned to mentors (if mentorId is provided)
- Existing assignments without mentors can be migrated using the provided script
