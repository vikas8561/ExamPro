### **Step 3: Deploy API Service**

1. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure:
   ```
   Name: judge0-api
   Root Directory: judge0-render/api
   Environment: Docker
   Plan: Starter ($7/month)
   Region: Same as database
   Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile
   ```
4. **Environment Variables** (Render will auto-populate from render.yaml):
   - `RAILS_ENV=production`
   - `POSTGRES_HOST` (from database)
   - `POSTGRES_PORT` (from database)
   - `POSTGRES_DB` (from database)
   - `POSTGRES_USER` (from database)
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (from database)
   - `REDIS_HOST` (from redis)
   - `REDIS_PORT` (from redis)
   - `REDIS_PASSWORD` (from redis)
   - `SECRET_KEY_BASE` (auto-generated)
   - `JUDGE0_VERSION=1.13.1`

5. Click **"Create Web Service"**

### **Step 4: Deploy Worker Service**

1. Click **"New +"** → **"Background Worker"**
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure:
   ```
   Name: judge0-worker
   Root Directory: judge0-render/worker
   Environment: Docker
   Plan: Starter ($7/month)
   Region: Same as database
   Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile
   ```
4. **Environment Variables** (same as API service)
5. Click **"Create Background Worker"**

## 📁 **File Structure Created**

```
judge0-render/
├── api/
│   ├── Dockerfile          # Official Judge0 API
│   ├── judge0.conf         # Configuration file
│   └── render.yaml         # Render deployment config
└── worker/

    └── render.yaml         # Render deployment config
```

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **API Service (`judge0-api`)**
- **Official Docker Image**: `judge0/judge0:latest`
- **Startup Script**: `/api/scripts/server`
- **Function**: Handles HTTP requests, database operations
- **Port**: 2358

### **Worker Service (`judge0-worker`)**
- **Official Docker Image**: `judge0/judge0:latest`
- **Startup Script**: `/api/scripts/workers`
- **Function**: Processes code execution jobs
- **Workers**: 4 concurrent processes

### **Database (PostgreSQL)**
- **Purpose**: Stores submissions, languages, metadata
- **Connection**: Auto-configured by Render

### **Redis**
- **Purpose**: Job queue management

## 🧪 **Testing Your Deployment**

### **1. Health Check**
```bash
curl https://your-api-url.onrender.com/
```

### **2. System Information**
```bash
curl https://your-api-url.onrender.com/system_info
```

### **3. Test Code Execution**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-url.onrender.com/submissions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_code": "print(\"Hello World\")",
    "language_id": 71,
    "stdin": ""
  }'
```

### **4. Get Results**
```bash
curl https://your-api-url.onrender.com/submissions/{submission_id}
```

## 🔗 **Update Your Application**

Update your `Backend/services/judge0.js`:

```javascript
const JUDGE0_INSTANCES = [
  'https://your-judge0-api.onrender.com',  // Your new API URL
  'http://localhost:2358'  // Local fallback
];
```

## 📊 **Supported Languages**
