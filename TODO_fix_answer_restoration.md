# Fix for Test Answer Restoration on Resume

## Problem Analysis
When a test is resumed after a tab violation or interruption, the previous answer data is not being properly restored. The issue appears to be in the answer restoration logic in the `loadExistingTestData` function.

## Root Cause
The current implementation in `loadExistingTestData` tries to fetch existing submissions but may not be handling the response structure correctly or the answers may not be properly restored to the component state.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Verify Backend Response Structure
- Check the actual response structure from `/test-submissions/assignment/${assignmentId}`
- Ensure the submission data contains the correct answer format

### 2. Improve Answer Restoration Logic
- Update the `loadExistingTestData` function to properly handle the response structure
- Add better error handling and logging to track the restoration process

### 3. Test the Fix
- Create test scenarios to verify that answers are properly restored
- Test with both MCQ and theoretical questions

### 4. Add Auto-save Functionality (Optional Enhancement)
- Implement periodic auto-save of answers during the test
- This would prevent data loss even if the browser crashes or the user accidentally closes the tab

## Current Implementation Status
The `loadExistingTestData` function already contains logic to:
1. Fetch assignment data
2. Calculate remaining time
3. Fetch existing submission
4. Restore answers from submission

However, the issue might be in:
- The response structure not matching expectations
- Answers not being properly set in the component state
- Timing issues with state updates

## Next Steps
1. Add detailed logging to track the answer restoration process
2. Verify the backend response structure
3. Test with different question types
4. Implement additional safety measures for answer persistence
