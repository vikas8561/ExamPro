# TODO: Automatic Refresh Implementation for Student Portal

## Overview
Implement real-time updates using Socket.IO so that when admin creates and assigns tests, the student portal automatically refreshes without manual refresh.

## Steps
- [x] Install Socket.IO dependencies (backend and frontend)
- [x] Set up Socket.IO server in Backend/server.js
- [x] Emit events in Backend/routes/assignments.js when assignments are created
- [x] Connect to Socket.IO in Frontend/src/pages/StudentDashboard.jsx
- [x] Listen for assignment events and refresh data
- [x] Test the implementation by creating/assigning tests

## Files to Edit
- Backend/package.json: Add socket.io ✅
- Frontend/package.json: Add socket.io-client ✅
- Backend/server.js: Add Socket.IO server setup ✅ (Fixed missing imports & routes)
- Backend/routes/assignments.js: Emit events on assignment creation ✅
- Frontend/src/pages/StudentDashboard.jsx: Listen for events and refresh ✅

## Testing
