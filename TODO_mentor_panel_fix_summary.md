# Mentor Panel Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The mentor panel was not showing test assignments and submissions because the frontend was calling incorrect API endpoints.

## Root Cause
The `MentorSubmissions.jsx` component was calling:
- `/test-submissions/mentor/pending` (incorrect endpoint)
- `/test-submissions/${submissionId}/review` (inconsistent endpoint)

But the correct endpoints are:
- `/mentor/submissions/pending` (mounted at `/api/mentor/submissions/pending`)
- `/mentor/submissions/${submissionId}/review` (mounted at `/api/mentor/submissions/${submissionId}/review`)

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (MentorSubmissions.jsx)
- **Line 16**: Changed API endpoint from `/test-submissions/mentor/pending` to `/mentor/submissions/pending`
- **Line 35**: Changed review endpoint from `/test-submissions/${submissionId}/review` to `/mentor/submissions/${submissionId}/review`
- Added debug console logs to help with troubleshooting

### 2. Backend Changes (testSubmissions.js)
- Added debug console logs to the `/mentor/pending` endpoint to help track:
  - Mentor ID being queried
  - Number of assignments found for the mentor
  - Assignment IDs being searched
  - Number of pending submissions found

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Mentor Dashboard**: Should now display pending submissions for review
2. **Debug Logs**: Console will show:
   - Frontend: "Fetching submissions for mentor..."
   - Backend: "Fetching pending submissions for mentor: [mentorId]"
   - Backend: "Found [X] assignments for mentor [mentorId]"
   - Backend: "Found [Y] pending submissions for review"
   - Frontend: "Received submissions data: [array of submissions]"

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the backend server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login as a mentor user** and navigate to the mentor submissions page

4. **Check browser console** for debug logs to verify:
   - API calls are being made to correct endpoints
   - Data is being received from the backend

5. **Verify submissions display**: The mentor panel should now show any pending submissions assigned to that mentor

## Potential Additional Issues to Check

1. **Mentor Assignment**: Ensure the mentor has assignments assigned to them in the database
2. **Test Submissions**: Ensure students have submitted tests that need review
3. **Database Connectivity**: Verify MongoDB connection is working properly

## Files Modified
- `Frontend/src/pages/MentorSubmissions.jsx`
- `Backend/routes/testSubmissions.js` (debug logs only)

## API Endpoint Structure
```
/api/mentor/submissions/pending          → GET pending submissions for mentor
/api/mentor/submissions/:id/review       → PUT review a submission
/api/test-submissions/mentor/pending     → Incorrect (not used)
/api/test-submissions/:id/review         → Alternative review endpoint (still functional)
```

The fix ensures consistency by using the mentor-specific endpoints throughout the mentor panel.
