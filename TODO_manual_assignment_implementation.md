# Manual Test Assignment Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement functionality for admins to manually assign tests to specific students, alongside the existing "assign to all" feature.

## Tasks to Complete

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] Add new endpoint `/assignments/assign-manual` in `Backend/routes/assignments.js`
- [ ] Implement validation for student IDs array and assignment parameters
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and response messages

### Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Modify assignment modal in `Frontend/src/pages/Tests.jsx` to support both assignment modes
- [ ] Add student selection interface with search and checkbox functionality
- [ ] Update API service to handle manual assignment requests
- [ ] Ensure UI is intuitive with clear toggling between assignment modes

### Testing
- [ ] Test "assign to all" functionality still works
- [ ] Test manual assignment with various student selections
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid inputs
- [ ] Test edge cases (no students selected, etc.)

## Current Progress
- [x] Analysis of existing codebase completed
- [x] Implementation plan created and approved
- [x] Backend implementation completed
