# Authentication Issues - Diagnosis & Solutions

## Issues Identified

### 1. Forgot Password Endpoint Returns 404
**Problem**: The `/api/auth/forgot-password` endpoint returns 404 Not Found
**Root Cause**: The deployed version on Render doesn't have the latest code with the forgot password route

### 2. Login Returns "Unauthorized" 
**Problem**: Login attempts return 401 Unauthorized
**Root Cause**: This is expected behavior for invalid credentials, but suggests user doesn't exist in database

### 3. Email Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Hardcoded email credentials in production code
**Root Cause**: Using hardcoded Gmail credentials instead of environment variables

## Solutions

### Immediate Fix: Redeploy Backend

The main issue is that the deployed version on Render doesn't have the latest code. You need to:

1. **Commit and push your latest code to Git**
2. **Trigger a new deployment on Render**

```bash
# In your backend directory
git add .
git commit -m "Fix authentication routes and forgot password functionality"
git push origin main
```

### Environment Variables Setup

Create these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM="ExamPro Support <your-email@gmail.com>"
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

### Code Improvements

1. **Remove hardcoded credentials** from `Backend/routes/auth.js`
2. **Add better error handling** for email failures
3. **Add input validation** for forgot password requests

## Testing After Deployment

After redeploying, test these endpoints:

1. **Health**: `GET https://cg-test-app.onrender.com/health`
2. **Login**: `POST https://cg-test-app.onrender.com/api/auth/login`
3. **Forgot Password**: `POST https://cg-test-app.onrender.com/api/auth/forgot-password`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Login should work with valid credentials
- ✅ Forgot password should send verification emails
- ✅ All auth endpoints should return proper responses
- ✅ No more 404 errors on forgot password

## Next Steps

1. Redeploy the backend with latest code
2. Set up proper environment variables
3. Test all authentication flows
4. Monitor server logs for any remaining issues
